## About me

<img class="profile-picture" src="ml.jpg">

I'm an Associated Professor and a Ph.D. supervisor affiliated with the School of Computer & Information Technology of Beijing Jiaotong University. 
In my research works I was working in the areas of communication theories and techniques, including  massive MIMO, space-time coding, Turbo receiver, optical fiber communications and physical layer identification. 
I'm now interested in the application of the recent advances of AI to the fundamental problems in communication systems.
